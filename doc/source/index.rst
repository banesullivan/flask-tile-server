A Flask application for serving tiles from large raster files in
the `Slippy Maps standard <https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames>`_
(i.e., ``/zoom/x/y.png``)

Launch a `demo <https://github.com/banesullivan/localtileserver-demo>`_ on MyBinder |binder|


üåü Highlights
-------------

- Launch a tile server for large geospatial images
- View local or remote* raster files with `ipyleaflet` or `folium` in Jupyter
- View rasters with CesiumJS with the built-in Flask web application
- Extract regions of interest (ROIs) interactively
- Use the example datasets to generate Digital Elevation Models

*remote raster files should be pre-tiled Cloud Optimized GeoTiffs*

‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview
-----------

This is a Flask application (blueprint) for serving tiles of large images.
The `TileClient` class can be used to to launch a tile server in a background
thread which will serve raster imagery to a viewer (see `ipyleaflet` and
`folium` Jupyter notebook examples below).

This tile server can efficiently deliver varying levels of detail of your
raster imagery to your viewer; it helps to have pre-tiled, Cloud Optimized
GeoTIFFs (COG), but no wories if not as the backing libraries,
`large_image <https://github.com/girder/large_image>`_,
will tile and cache for you when opening the raster.

There is an included, standalone web viewer leveraging
`CesiumJS <https://cesium.com/platform/cesiumjs/>`_ and `GeoJS <https://opengeoscience.github.io/geojs/>`_.
You can use the web viewer to select and extract regions of interest from rasters.


.. note::

   This is a hobby project and I am doing my best to make it
   more stable/robust. Things might break between minor releases (I use the
   ``major.minor.patch`` versioning scheme).
